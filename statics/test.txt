The strongest typhoon to hit Japan's mainland in 25 years smashed a tanker into a bridge,
forcing one of the country's largest airports to close and hundreds of flights to be canceled.
At least 10 people have died since Typhoon Jebi slammed into western Japan Tuesday,
bringing strong winds and lashing rain.
Seven of those killed were in Osaka Prefecture and the others in Mie, Aichi and Shiga,
where police said a man in Higashiomi City died after the warehouse he was working in collapsed.
Typhoon Jebi landed with "very strong" force in Tokushima prefecture Tuesday afternoon, the strongest
typhoon to hit the country's mainland since 1993, said Akihiro Kikuchi, from Japan's Meteorological Agency.
Winds lashed buildings and whipped up the sea, yanking an 89-meter-long tanker,
the Houunmaru, from its anchorage and ramming it into the bridge connecting Kansai Airport with the mainland.
Images showed the ship's upper decks smashed against bridge, dislodging a portion
of the road and forcing authorities to close it to traffic.
Eleven crew members were on board, but no one was injured in the incident, Coast Guard spokesman Keita Sakai said.
A tanker rests after slamming into the side of an Osaka bridge that connects the airport to the mainland,
 damaging part of the bridge and the vessel.
The bridge reopened on Wednesday but not before around 3,000 passengers
spent a night trapped in the airport. Some were evacuated on buses Wednesday
 morning to Izumisano Station in Osaka City.
Hundreds of others planned to leave on high speed boats dispatched to Kansai
Airport Wednesday to ferry passengers to Kobe Airport to catch alternative flights.
Each boat was capable of carrying 110 passengers, and would go back and forth
until all passengers were evacuated, Mami Yamaguchi from the New Kansai International Airport Company told CNN.
The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said Wednesday that more than 400 people had been injured across 20 prefectures.
